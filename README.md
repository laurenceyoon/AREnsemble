'AR Ensemble Space' is an augmented reality (AR) music visualization system that creates visual effects based on music information and applies spatial (3D) sound. It aims to enrich the music ensemble experience for audiences and musicians in personal space and bridge the gap between virtual and real concerts. Additionally, a musician or conductor who finds it difficult to simulate multiple instruments before rehearsal can also simulate on the given stage with augmented reality objects in our system.
